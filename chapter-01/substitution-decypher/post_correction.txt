because the practice of the basic movements of wata is
the focus and mastery of self is the essence of
matsubayashi ryu warate do i shall try to elucidate the
movements of the wata according to my interpretation

significance and some must remain unexplained to give a
complete explanation one kould have to be qualified and
inspired to such an extent that he could reach the state
of enlightened mind capable of recognijing soundless
sound and shapeless shape i do not deem myself the final
authority but my experience kith wata has left no doubt
that the folloking is the proper application and
interpretation i offer my theories in the hope that the
essence of owinakan warate kill remain intact
